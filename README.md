## E-book reader for Sailfish OS

![icon](app/harbour-books.png)

The core functionality is based on [FBReader](https://github.com/geometer/FBReader) source code with very few modifications. Books are imported from the Downloads folder, where they are saved by the browser or email client. Alternatively, you can manually copy your books to the Books directory under the home folder. Removable storage is supported as well. In theory, it should be able to handle all E-book formats supported by FBReader. Tested mostly with epub and fb2.
